ARRAYTOOL MANUAL AND HOW TO

- FOR GENERAL OPTIONS CHOOSE PARAMETERS IN GLOBAL.CONF
- EVENT DEPENDENT OPTIONS YOU CAN CHANGE IN THE CONFIG FILE OF THE EVENT IN THE EVENTFOLDER


PROCESSING STEPS:

STEP 0) PYTHON ARRAYTOOL.PY LIST: - LISTS ALL EVENTS IN THE EVENTFOLDER (CONFIG AND ORIG FILE MUST EXIST) (OPTIONAL, JUST TO SEE WHICH EVENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO PROCESS)

STEP 1) PYTHON ARRAYTOOL.PY SEARCH: - SEARCH FOR EARTHQUAKES TO PROCESS IN GLOBAL CATALOGS
                                    - SEARCHPARAMETER ARE DEFINED IN GLOBAL.CONF
                                    - POSSIBLE PARAMETER: - date from to
                                                     - magnitude
                                                     - catalog
                                                     - number of result

                            
STEP 2) PYTHON ARRAYTOOL.PY CREATE EVENTID: - CREATES EVENTFOLDER IN EVENTS 
                                            - USE EVENTID FROM SEARCH TO START CREATING EVENT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
                                                (COPIES EXAMPLE.CONFIG FROM SKELETON FOLDER)
                                    
                                    
STEP 3) PYTHON ARRAYTOOL.PY GETSTATIONS EVENTFOLDERNAME: - SEARCH FOR STATION IN IRIS AND WEBDC WITH SEARCHPARAMETERS DEFINED IN GLOBAL.CONF
                                                         - POSSIBLE PARAMETER: - MINDISTANCE FROM EVENT
                                                                            - MAXDISTANCE FROM EVENT
                                                                            - NETWORKS FOR BLACKLIST

                                                      
STEP 4) PYTHON ARRAYTOOL.PY GETDATA EVENTFOLDERNAME: - ACQUISITION OF ARCHIVED WAVEFORMDATA FROM IRIS AND EIDA SAVED AS SDS IN THE EVENTFOLDER
                                                     - COPY KEYFOLDERNAME FROM STEP 3 INTO GLOBAL.CONF
                                                     - POSSIBLE PARAMETER: - KEYFOLDER
                                                     - DURATION OF WAVEFORMDATA


STEP 5) PYTHON ARRAYTOOL.PY GETMETA EVENTFOLDERNAME: - CREATE FILE WITH METAINFORMATION FROM EVERY STATION WHICH HAS DATA IN SDS STRUCTURE


STEP 6) PYTHON ARRAYTOOL.PY PLOTSTATIONS EVENTFOLDERNAME: - CREATE EPICENTRAL WORLDMAPPLOT TO SHOW THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE STATIONS (OPTIONAL, JUST TO SEE WHICH STATIONDATA I HAVE)
